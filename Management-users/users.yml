#✅ Tasks to implement:
        #Create a group named opsdev
        
        #Only on hosts that are part of both dev and test inventory groups.
        
        #Create users from the list defined in user-list.yml
        
        #Only on hosts in the dev group.
        
        #Only if the user’s job is developer.
        
        #Each user must have:
              
                #A specific uid
                 #A hashed password stored securely using pw_manager from vault.yml     
                 #A password expiration policy based on password_expire_days
        #Create a group named opsmgr
        #Only on hosts that belong to the test group and are listed as manager.
        #Create manager users from the list
        #Only on hosts that are part of both dev and manager groups.
        #Only if the user’s job is manager.
        #Each user must have:
            #A specific uid
            #A hashed password
            #A password expiration policy
